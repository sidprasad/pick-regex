# Agent Guidelines

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Testing and documentation expectations
- Every change must be accompanied by an automated test when feasible. If a test cannot be added, record the manual verification performed in the `manual-testing/` directory (add a new markdown file or update an existing one).
- Avoid updating `README.md` for documentation changes. Add supporting notes to relevant files or to `manual-testing/` instead.

## PR and review hygiene
- Keep changes small and focused. Include context in commit messages when tests are intentionally omitted.
